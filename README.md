# Description
It is a basic terminal built in c language. It contains various functions like seek , warp , execute path
etc as stated in the mini project document . 

# Assumptions
1 i am assuming that the pastevents execute command does not give argument greater than 9
2 i am assuming that that the oldest argument is not being given as input when history is of length less than 15
3. A history.txt file has already been created.
4. For specification 6 the proceses run in foreground and background as required but the status of background process is not being printed after the next input is entered.
5. Some of the part of seek command is left which will be completed by the end of project.
6. There might be some printf statements between the code which by mistake might  not be commented.However
it doesen't affect the flow of code.
7. It might be possible that few commands or flags might not work but i will ensure that it would work by
the end of the project.
